"<b>Polymorph</b>\n"
"A polymorph {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} transforms your physical body to "
"take on the shape of another creature. Each polymorph spell allows you to "
"assume the form of a creature of a specific type, granting you a number of "
"{g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g} to your {g|Encyclopedia:Ability_Scores}"
"ability scores{/g} and a bonus to your natural armor. In addition, each "
"polymorph spell can grant you a number of other benefits, including movement "
"types, resistances, and senses. If the form you choose grants these "
"benefits, or a greater ability of the same type, you gain the listed "
"benefit. If the form grants a lesser ability of the same type, you gain the "
"lesser ability instead. Your base {g|Encyclopedia:Speed}speed{/g} changes to "
"match that of the form you assume. The {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} for any of "
"these abilities equals your DC for the polymorph spell used to change you "
"into that form.\n"
"In addition to these benefits, you gain any of the "
"{g|Encyclopedia:NaturalAttack}natural attacks{/g} of the base creature, "
"including proficiency in those {g|Encyclopedia:Attack}attacks{/g}. These "
"attacks are based on your {g|Encyclopedia:BAB}base attack bonus{/g}, "
"modified by your {g|Encyclopedia:Strength}Strength{/g} or "
"{g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} as appropriate, and use your "
"Strength modifier for determining {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g} bonuses."
"\n"
"If a polymorph spell causes you to change size, apply the size modifiers "
"appropriately, changing your {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}armor class{/g}, "
"attack bonus, {g|Encyclopedia:CMB}Combat Maneuver Bonus{/g}, and "
"{g|Encyclopedia:Stealth}Stealth{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} "
"modifiers. Your ability scores are not modified by this change unless noted "
"by the spell.\n"
"Unless otherwise noted, polymorph spells cannot be used to change into "
"specific individuals. Although many of the fine details can be controlled, "
"your appearance is always that of a generic member of that creature's type.\n"
"When you cast a polymorph spell that changes you into a creature of the "
"animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin type, all of your "
"gear melds into your body. Items that provide constant bonuses and do not "
"need to be activated continue to function while melded in this way (with the "
"exception of armor and shield bonuses, which cease to function). Items that "
"require activation cannot be used while you maintain that form. While in "
"such a form, you cannot cast any spells that require material components, "
"and can only cast spells with somatic or verbal components if the form you "
"choose has the capability to make such movements or speak, such as a dragon. "
"If your new form does not cause your equipment to meld into your form, the "
"equipment resizes to match your new {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g}.\n"
"While under the effects of a polymorph spell, you lose all extraordinary and "
"{g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}supernatural abilities{/g} that depend on "
"your original form (such as keen senses, scent, and darkvision), as well as "
"any natural attacks and movement types possessed by your original form. You "
"also lose any class features that depend upon form, but those that allow you "
"to add features (such as sorcerers that can grow claws) still function. Your "
"new form might restore a number of these abilities if they are possessed by "
"the new form.\n"
"You can only be affected by one polymorph spell at a time. If a new "
"polymorph spell is cast on you (or you activate a polymorph effect, such as "
"wild shape), you can decide whether or not to allow it to affect you, taking "
"the place of the old spell. In addition, other spells that change your size "
"have no effect on you while you are under the effects of a polymorph spell."
